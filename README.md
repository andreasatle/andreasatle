# 👋 Hi, I’m Andreas Atle (@andreasatle)

I’m an **AI/ML Engineer** with a background in **Applied Mathematics (Ph.D.)** and over 15 years of experience building high-performance algorithms. My current focus is on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **agentic AI systems**, and **GPU-accelerated computing**.

## 🔭 What I’m working on
- Designing **agentic workflows** with the OpenAI Agent SDK and Pydantic for large-scale document extraction and validation.  
- Building **RAG pipelines** with embeddings (ChromaDB, Hugging Face, OpenAI) for legal and financial data search.  
- Exploring **GPU computing on Apple Silicon** — recently implemented a **Mandelbrot solver in Swift + Metal**.  
- Continuing to refine my skills across languages: Python, Go, Swift, Zig, Rust, and C++.

## 💡 Interests
- Large Language Models (LLMs), embeddings, and multi-agent AI systems.  
- GPU acceleration with **CUDA, Metal, OpenCL**.  
- Advanced numerical algorithms, scientific computing, and fractals.  
- Comparing programming languages through LeetCode, Project Euler, and Exercism challenges.  

## 📚 Background
- Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (Stockholm University).  
- Former **Research Scientist at Total E&P USA** (seismic imaging, HPC, CUDA).  
- **Software Developer at Spectacle LLC** (deployed ML models to production on AWS/Kubernetes).  

## 🤝 Collaboration
I’m always open to collaborating on **LLM applications, GPU/AI workflows, and open-source projects**.
