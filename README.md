- 👋 Hi, I’m @andreasatle
- 👀 I’m interested in all things computing and math.
- 🌱 The last couple of years I have come to appreciate the golang language. It's a very nice language to work with. Many things are very elegant. It eats quite a bit of memory though, with GC and all.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Rust programming language, which seem to us about half the memory as golang for the same algorithms. Gosh the compiler is very picky with how you write the code. That is a good thing though, since you can be more safe if you take care of many checks in compile time.
- 🌱 Lucky me that I'm not a javascript programmer, with a garbage in garbage out culture. It is quite handy though, to not crash your internet-pages, by some type error. It would be very hard to approach Rust coming from js.
- 🌱 I also like python, even though it also endorse the garbage in garbage out culture. Even with the type-hinting, the interpreter doesn't seem to care about it. At least it is good to document the types so that the user understands the intended use-case.
- 🌱 It is quite interesting to compare different languages on e.g. LeetCode. All of a sudden I have solved more than 300 problems on LeetCode. I also managed to solve all daily problems the entire month of April this year. Let be that I was late one day, but still...
- 🌱 I recently started to use the cite exercism.io to write some easy stardard algorithms is (currently) 4 different languages, go, python, rust and javascript (node.js).
- 🌱 The last two years, I have been rather obseesed with the Euler project, which is a site for solving math-problems using computer algorithms. I have solved 160 problems out of about 750, and they are getting increasingly harder to solve.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, since I'm looking for a job.
